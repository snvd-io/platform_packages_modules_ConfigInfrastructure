    <!-- The start (inclusive) and end (exclusive) hours for unattended reboot window.
         To enforce the reboot window constraint, the values should be in [0, 23], and they should
         not be equal to each other. Otherwise, a default window will be used.
         If the start hour is bigger than the end hour, it will be treated as if the end hour is on
         the next day. E.g. if start==22 and end==1, the reboot window will be from 10pm to 1am.
         To remove reboot window constraints, set both `config_unattendedRebootStartHour`
         and `config_unattendedRebootEndHour` to -1.-->
